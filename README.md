# College eCommerce Group IV

This repository contains the database design and implementation for an eCommerce platform for a Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) college in Machakos County, Kenya. The platform aims to provide an online presence and marketplace for the college's various entrepreneurial activities, including cafeterias, tuck shops, pharmacies, bookshops, and digital centers across its five locations.

## Project Background

The TVET college seeks to expand its entrepreneurial activities and establish an online presence through an eCommerce web application. This application will allow students, staff, and guests to access and purchase services and products offered by the college's various business ventures, such as cafeterias, tuck shops, pharmacies, bookshops, and digital centers.

## Database Design

The database system has been designed and implemented using PostgreSQL, with at least eight tables to capture the necessary data from the given scenario. The database has been normalized to ensure data integrity, and denormalization techniques have been applied where appropriate for performance optimization.

## Key Features

- **Indexing**: Appropriate indexing has been implemented to optimize query performance and enable efficient data retrieval for the web application.
- **Triggers and Procedures**: Triggers and stored procedures have been created to capture online transactions and perform necessary operations within the database.
- **API Integration**: Swagger has been used as the API integration platform, allowing for seamless integration between the database and the web application.
- **Web Dashboard**: A simple web page with a dashboard has been developed to showcase the functionality of the eCommerce platform and its integration with the database.
